# Time-Series-Analysis

In this project, we analyse 2 Non-Seasonal datasets:

1. Microsoft Stock Prices (Financial Dataset)
2. US Regional Sales (Non-Financial Dataset)

Our main objective is to find the best model that fits both these datasets correctly with residuals showing minimum correlation among them across different time lags. We consider several ARIMA and GARCH models and find out the best combination of orders of AR and MA to fit the dataset. Further, we use forecasting to predict near future values and observe how the fitted model works for the data.

Analysing a time series data, helps identify the trends, seasonality, and systematic patterns over the time. It also helps in making predictions in upcoming period of time.
